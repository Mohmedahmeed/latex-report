\section{Introduction}

Sprint 3, titled "Breakdown Management and Intervention Planning," introduces critical reactive and proactive maintenance capabilities building upon the site and equipment foundations from Sprints 1 and 2. This sprint addresses user stories US-007 (Intervention Planning), US-008 (Technician Assignment), and US-009 (Intervention Tracking) from Chapter 2's product backlog, implementing comprehensive fault reporting and scheduled maintenance management.

Network breakdowns represent urgent situations requiring immediate attention, such as power outages, equipment failures, or connectivity losses significantly impacting service quality and affecting thousands of users. The intervention planning module enables managers and engineers to schedule preventive maintenance tasks, assign technicians based on skills and availability, and track maintenance activities systematically. Together, these modules create a comprehensive maintenance management system balancing reactive problem-solving with proactive prevention strategies, directly supporting the operational requirements identified in Chapter 2 for Network Engineers and Field Technicians.

\section{Sprint Backlog}

During sprint planning, we defined the tasks required for Sprint 3 implementation. Table 5.1 presents the sprint backlog with user stories, tasks, complexity assessments, and effort estimates.

\caption{Sprint 3 Backlog with Task Breakdown}
\label{tab:sprint3_backlog}
\end{table}

The backlog totals 46 hours across eight major functionalities. Conflict detection complexity stems from time overlap calculation requirements across multiple concurrent interventions. Severity-based escalation requires real-time notification infrastructure ensuring critical breakdowns receive immediate management attention.

\section{Conceptual Design}

This section presents the conceptual design models guiding Sprint 3 implementation.

\subsection{Class Diagram}

Figure 5.1 presents the class diagram introducing two core entities: Breakdown and Intervention, working with existing entities for comprehensive maintenance management.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{img/chap_05/sprint3_class_diagram.png}
    \caption{Class Diagram - Breakdown and Intervention Management}
    \label{fig:class_diagram_sprint3}
\end{figure}


The class diagram (Figure 5.1) illustrates two primary entities using UML standard notation (name : type format). The Breakdown class represents network failures requiring immediate attention, tracking breakdown type classifications (power, hardware, software, environmental), severity levels (minor, major, critical) determining escalation procedures, and status workflow (open, investigating, in progress, resolved, closed). It maintains comprehensive timestamps capturing the entire lifecycle from initial report through resolution, tracks user impact through \texttt{impact\_users} quantifying affected subscribers, calculates downtime duration automatically from start and end timestamps, and associates with sites and equipment for geographical and asset tracking. The Intervention class manages scheduled maintenance activities, categorizing by intervention type (preventive, corrective, installation, replacement) reflecting maintenance strategy, priority levels (low, medium, high, critical) enabling resource allocation, and status tracking (scheduled, in progress, completed, cancelled). Both entities maintain associations with Profile entities for assignment tracking, Site entities for location management, and Equipment entities for asset-specific maintenance, ensuring comprehensive integration with network infrastructure established in previous sprints.

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}

Figure 5.2 presents the use case diagram employing inheritance-based permission hierarchy where each role inherits capabilities from lower roles while adding specific functionalities.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{img/chap_05/sprint3_usecase_diagram.png}
    \caption{Use Case Diagram - Sprint 3 with Role Inheritance}
    \label{fig:use_case_diagram_sprint3}
\end{figure}

The use case diagram (Figure 5.2) demonstrates the role inheritance hierarchy established in previous sprints. Field Technicians possess base operational capabilities including viewing assigned interventions enabling focused task management, updating intervention status providing real-time progress tracking, reporting breakdowns enabling rapid incident documentation, and viewing breakdown details supporting problem resolution. Managers inherit all technician capabilities while adding supervisory functions including viewing intervention and breakdown statistics for operational oversight, scheduling interventions enabling preventive maintenance planning, assigning technicians to interventions optimizing resource allocation, tracking downtime duration quantifying service impact, and monitoring impact metrics supporting strategic decisions. Network Engineers inherit all manager capabilities while adding technical analysis functions including conducting root cause analysis preventing recurrence, creating detailed intervention plans specifying technical procedures, editing breakdown information ensuring accurate documentation, and linking breakdowns to specific equipment supporting asset management. Administrators inherit all engineer capabilities while possessing exclusive system management rights including deleting breakdowns and interventions for data lifecycle management, cancelling scheduled interventions supporting operational flexibility, and configuring system parameters ensuring proper operation.

\textbf{Use Case Description: Report Breakdown}

Since breakdown and intervention operations share workflow patterns, we provide detailed information on the "Report Breakdown" use case as representative of Sprint 3 functionality. Table 5.2 presents the detailed textual description.

\end{table}

\section{Sequence Diagrams}

This section presents sequence diagrams detailing the main processes implemented in Sprint 3.

\subsection{Schedule Intervention Process}

Figure 5.3 demonstrates the complete workflow for scheduling maintenance interventions with conflict detection and technician assignment.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{img/chap_05/sprint3_sequence_intervention.png}
    \caption{Sequence Diagram - Schedule Intervention Process}
    \label{fig:sequence_schedule_intervention}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Note on Sequence Diagram:} Following UML sequence diagram standards, return messages should use dashed arrows (-->) while request messages use solid arrows (->), clearly distinguishing between calls and responses.

The schedule intervention sequence (Figure 5.3) demonstrates the workflow for planning preventive or corrective maintenance activities. An authorized user (Manager, Engineer, or Administrator) accesses the intervention management interface and clicks "Schedule Intervention" displaying the scheduling form. The user completes intervention details including descriptive title, intervention type selection (preventive, corrective, installation, replacement), priority level assignment, target site selection, optional equipment specification, technician assignment from available personnel, scheduled date and time selection, and estimated duration specification. Upon form submission, the validation system performs comprehensive checks on required fields ensuring data completeness. If validation succeeds, the system queries existing interventions for the assigned technician checking for time conflicts. The conflict detection algorithm calculates intervention time windows by adding estimated duration to scheduled start time, compares against existing commitments, and identifies overlaps. If no conflicts exist, the request proceeds to Supabase via \texttt{supabase.from('interventions').insert()} with Row Level Security verification ensuring only managers, engineers, and administrators can schedule interventions. The database creates the intervention record with "scheduled" status and sends notifications to assigned technician. The intervention list updates in real-time across all user sessions via Supabase subscriptions. If conflicts are detected, the system displays conflict details with overlapping intervention information enabling rescheduling decisions. Validation failures display specific error messages guiding correction.

\subsection{Report Breakdown Process}

Figure 5.4 illustrates the workflow for reporting network breakdowns including severity-based escalation for critical issues.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{img/chap_05/sprint3_sequence_breakdown.png}
    \caption{Sequence Diagram - Report Breakdown Process}
    \label{fig:sequence_report_breakdown}
\end{figure}

The report breakdown sequence (Figure 5.4) illustrates the incident reporting workflow supporting rapid response to network failures. When a user (Engineer, Manager, or Technician) identifies a network issue, they access the breakdown management interface and click "Report Breakdown" displaying the reporting form. The user provides comprehensive breakdown information including descriptive title summarizing the issue, detailed description explaining symptoms and observations, breakdown type classification (power failure, hardware malfunction, software error, environmental issue), severity level selection (minor, major, critical) determining response urgency, affected site selection from dropdown, optional affected equipment specification for asset-specific issues, and impact estimation including affected user count and expected resolution timeframe. Upon form submission, client-side validation ensures required fields are completed. Valid submissions proceed to Supabase with automatic timestamp capture recording the exact breakdown occurrence time and initiating downtime tracking. The database verifies user permissions through Row Level Security (all authenticated users can report breakdowns supporting rapid incident response) and creates the breakdown record with "open" status. If severity is marked "critical", the system immediately triggers escalation workflow sending real-time notifications to all managers and operations supervisors, displaying breakdown with urgent visual indicators, and prioritizing in management dashboards. Upon successful creation, the breakdown list updates in real-time across active sessions, the form closes, and success confirmation displays. For non-critical breakdowns, standard notification procedures apply. Validation failures display specific field errors enabling quick correction and resubmission.

\section{Implementation}

The breakdown dashboard (Figure 5.6) features comprehensive metrics including open issues requiring attention, critical breakdowns needing immediate response, in-progress resolutions currently being addressed, total breakdown count providing historical context, and total impacted users quantifying service impact. The breakdown table displays breakdown title with brief description, severity level with color coding (red for critical, orange for major, yellow for minor), priority assignment, current status in resolution workflow, affected site location, estimated user impact, downtime duration calculated in real-time, and action buttons (view details, assign technician, update status, resolve) with role-appropriate visibility.

\subsection{Schedule Intervention Form}

Figure 5.7 presents the intervention scheduling form enabling preventive and corrective maintenance planning.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/chap_05/screenshot_schedule_intervention.png}
    \caption{Schedule Intervention Form with Conflict Detection}
    \label{fig:schedule_intervention_form}
\end{figure}

The intervention scheduling form (Figure 5.7) includes required fields for task title describing the maintenance activity, intervention type selection (preventive, corrective, installation, replacement), priority level assignment, target site dropdown with search capability, optional equipment selection for asset-specific maintenance, technician assignment from available personnel list, scheduled date picker with calendar interface, and estimated duration slider for time allocation. The form implements comprehensive validation ensuring data completeness, conflict detection alerting when technician already has scheduled interventions during proposed time, and real-time availability checking displaying technician workload. Submit action creates intervention and sends notification to assigned technician.

\subsection{Report Breakdown Form}

Figure 5.8 illustrates the breakdown reporting form enabling rapid incident documentation with severity classification.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/chap_05/screenshot_report_breakdown.png}
    \caption{Report Breakdown Form with Impact Estimation}
    \label{fig:report_breakdown_form}
\end{figure}

The breakdown reporting form (Figure 5.8) enables efficient incident documentation with fields for breakdown title providing concise issue summary, detailed description explaining symptoms and context, breakdown type dropdown (power, hardware, software, environmental), severity classification (minor, major, critical) with color-coded indicators, affected site selection with search capability, optional affected equipment dropdown loading dynamically based on site selection, impact estimation including affected user count slider and expected resolution time input, and automatic downtime tracking initialization. Critical severity selection displays warning message confirming management escalation. Form validation ensures required fields completion before submission.

\section{Technical Challenges and Solutions}

Sprint 3 implementation encountered several technical challenges requiring systematic analysis and innovative solutions.

\subsection{Technician Assignment Conflict Detection}

Preventing technician double-booking when scheduling interventions required detecting time overlaps with variable-duration tasks stored as database timestamps. The challenge involved calculating intervention time windows from start time plus duration, comparing against all existing interventions for the same technician, and identifying any overlaps in the calculated time ranges. The solution implemented a conflict detection algorithm executing database queries to retrieve all interventions for the assigned technician within a relevant timeframe. The algorithm calculates each intervention's end time by adding estimated duration to scheduled start time, compares the proposed intervention's time window (start to calculated end) against existing intervention windows, and detects overlaps when proposed start falls within existing window or proposed end falls within existing window. The system displays conflict warnings with detailed information about overlapping interventions while allowing managers flexibility to override conflicts for emergency situations, supporting both conflict prevention and operational flexibility.

\subsection{Real-time Downtime Duration Calculation}

Displaying continuously updating breakdown duration in human-readable format without constant database queries or page refreshes presented performance challenges. The solution implemented client-side calculation function computing elapsed time from stored downtime start timestamp maintained in the database. The JavaScript function retrieves current time, calculates difference from downtime start timestamp, and intelligently formats duration: under 1 hour displays as "< 1h" for brevity, under 24 hours displays as hours with decimal precision, and longer durations display as days plus hours for clarity. The UI component recalculates every minute using setInterval, providing accurate current downtime information without database load, supporting real-time operational awareness while maintaining system performance.

\subsection{Cascading Status Updates and Timestamp Management}

Multiple status transitions requiring automatic timestamp capture (acknowledged, investigating, resolved, closed) without manual entry while triggering related actions like downtime calculation and notification delivery required careful workflow design. The solution implemented automatic timestamp capture in database update logic by detecting status changes through comparison of old and new values. When breakdown status transitions to "investigating", the system automatically sets \texttt{acknowledged\_at} timestamp; when transitioning to "resolved", sets both \texttt{resolved\_at} and \texttt{downtime\_end} timestamps enabling automatic duration calculation; and when transitioning to "closed", verifies all prior timestamps exist ensuring workflow compliance. This approach ensures data consistency, provides accurate audit trails for compliance requirements, eliminates manual timestamp entry reducing user workload, and triggers appropriate notifications and dashboard updates maintaining stakeholder awareness throughout the resolution process.

\section{Testing and Validation}

Sprint 3 underwent comprehensive testing ensuring reliability, workflow integrity, and proper integration with existing system components.

Intervention scheduling tests validated form submission for all intervention types (preventive, corrective, installation, replacement), confirmed technician assignment with workload checking, verified conflict detection identifies overlapping time slots accurately, and ensured notification delivery to assigned technicians. Status update tests confirmed workflow transitions respect role permissions, verified automatic timestamp capture for all transition points, and ensured real-time dashboard updates reflect current system state. CRUD operations for both breakdowns and interventions ensured data integrity with proper validation and constraint enforcement.

\subsection{Integration Testing}

Integration testing ensured Sprint 3 components work seamlessly with existing modules from Sprints 1 and 2. Site and equipment integration tests verified resource selection when reporting breakdowns, confirmed equipment dropdown population based on selected site, and ensured proper foreign key relationships maintain referential integrity. Authentication and authorization tests verified role-based permission hierarchy works correctly, confirmed managers can schedule interventions while technicians can only update status, and ensured administrators possess all privileges. Real-time notification tests confirmed managers receive critical breakdown alerts immediately, verified technicians receive intervention assignment notifications, and ensured notification delivery across multiple devices and browsers. Database relationship tests verified foreign key enforcement prevents orphaned records, confirmed cascade behaviors work correctly, and ensured referential integrity maintained during record deletion. Dashboard statistics tests validated accurate calculation from source data, confirmed real-time recalculation when underlying data changes, and ensured statistics match manual counts.
