\section{Introduction}

The successful development of any complex software system requires thorough planning and a well-defined architecture that addresses both current requirements and future scalability needs. This chapter presents the comprehensive planning and architectural design of the TelecomOps application, a mission-critical system for managing mobile network infrastructure at Tunisie Telecom.

The planning phase encompasses detailed stakeholder analysis, requirements specification, and project organization using the Scrum methodology. The architectural design addresses the technical challenges of building a scalable, secure, and maintainable system capable of managing thousands of telecommunications sites across Tunisia's diverse geographical landscape.

Through systematic analysis of user needs, operational workflows, and technical constraints, we establish the foundation for a robust solution that enhances operational efficiency while ensuring data security and system reliability. The chapter concludes with detailed technical specifications that guide the implementation phases and ensure alignment with both business objectives and technical best practices.

\section*{Conclusion}

This chapter has established a comprehensive planning and architectural foundation for the TelecomOps project, providing detailed specifications that ensure systematic development of a robust telecommunications infrastructure management solution. Through thorough stakeholder analysis, we have identified four distinct user roles with specific operational requirements and access patterns that drive the system's role-based security architecture.

The requirements specification encompasses both functional capabilities essential for telecommunications operations and non-functional requirements that ensure system reliability, security, and performance under operational conditions. The product backlog, organized into 23 prioritized user stories, provides a clear development roadmap that addresses core telecommunications management needs while enabling future enhancement opportunities.

The six-sprint development approach, implementing Scrum methodology, ensures iterative delivery of value while maintaining stakeholder engagement and enabling continuous refinement of system capabilities. Each sprint focuses on specific functional domains, building progressively from foundational authentication and user management through advanced analytics and reporting capabilities.

The technical architecture, combining Next.js frontend technology with Supabase backend services, provides a modern, scalable foundation that addresses the complex requirements of mobile network infrastructure management. The three-tier architecture ensures clear separation of concerns while enabling independent scaling and maintenance of different system components.

The comprehensive security architecture implements defense-in-depth principles with multiple layers of protection, ensuring that sensitive telecommunications infrastructure data remains secure while enabling appropriate access for operational teams. The integration of Row Level Security with role-based access control provides granular data protection that aligns with organizational security policies.

Technology selection prioritizes proven, mature solutions that balance development efficiency with operational reliability. The chosen stack enables rapid development while providing enterprise-grade capabilities for security, performance, and scalability. The deployment architecture leverages cloud-native approaches to ensure high availability and optimal performance for users across Tunisia's geographical regions.

With this comprehensive planning and architectural foundation established, the project is well-positioned for systematic implementation that addresses the operational needs of Tunisie Telecom's mobile network infrastructure management while providing a scalable platform for future technological evolution and business growth.
